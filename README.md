## Description

So the motivation for this project stems from a personal love for animals! Built with the aim of rehoming, 
rescuing and aiding in the recovery of animals, both physically and mentally. So, the app itself helps us 
use a database to great effect in terms of housing these animals and assigning staff members as carers.

## Installation

So, if you'd like to make your own additions to this API and get the development environment set up correctly, please follow these steps:
- Firstly, at the bare minimum you will need some sort of IDE, preferably one that supports Java quite well. In our case, we'll be using
  Eclipse. Here's a link to help you get started on installing Eclipse [Eclipse installation:](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/installer)
- Next, we want to ensure we correctly add Spring Boot and Maven. [Maven:](https://www.java.com/download/ie_manual.jsp) [Spring Boot:](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/getting-started.html)
- After you have both of these up and running, we can start to get busy with the fun stuff!
- Now, all you'll have to do from here is fork the repository and clone it to your desired directory.
- If that's done, it's time to run the app. In order to do this, one would need to open the 'Boot Dashboard' which should now show by default if Spring Boot is installed correctly.
- Inside of the Spring Boot dashboard, you'll see the project and upon clicking it you should see some options light up above it.
- While your curiosity may drive you to inspect the other options, the first button is the main one for running the API. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84280851/165960962-94a19d03-a2f2-4e65-a58b-221858706bb9.png)

## Usage

To use this App, you'll need the front end or some sort of testing tool like Postman.
In our case, we already have the front-end. [Front-end](https://github.com/Lee0997/my_shelter_front)
Now, you can either fork and clone this repo too (advised) or simply open the app through GitHub pages found on the repo.
Upon opening this page you'll see this homepage: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84280851/165961559-dad3ed8c-a04c-4858-8c4a-e04f1de5e4fe.png)
Simply navigate through this site using the navbar at the top and you'll find all of the functions required for using the API.

## Tests

So, if you'd like to use the tests you'll find them in the tests package as shown:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84280851/165963689-d8c7fbf6-c15d-4934-8604-79d07dbd3689.png)
If you'd like to run them, you'll simply have to right click the project and go down to 'Coverage As' and then click on the 'Junit' option.
This will then run the tests over the whole project. Apply the same logic to individual tests if you'd like.
